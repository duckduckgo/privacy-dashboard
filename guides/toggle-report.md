# Toggle Report

Live example: https://duckduckgo.github.io/privacy-dashboard/app-debug/html/iframe.html?screen=toggleReport

## Step 1: Open the dashboard with params

-   `screen=toggleReport`
-   `opener=menu`
    -   or `opener=dashboard`

## Step 2: Ensure base data is present

When opening the dashboard, there are requirements like `locale` and others that should be met.
Note: you may to stub some data with empty arrays - please see the previous breakage form work as reference.

## Step 3: Implement the **new** data handler

This is called immediately to retrieve the data needed to render the list.

[Sample JSON üìù](../schema/__fixtures__/toggle-report-screen.json)

-   WebKit: {@link "macOS integration".privacyDashboardGetToggleReportOptions}
-   Other platforms will be added

## Step 4: Implement new handlers

The following are all sent in response to user interactions

### üëÜSending/rejecting the report

-   WebKit: {@link "macOS integration".privacyDashboardSendToggleReport}
-   WebKit: {@link "macOS integration".privacyDashboardRejectToggleReport}

### üëÜTapping the 'see what's sent' list

-   Webkit: {@link "macOS integration".privacyDashboardSeeWhatIsSent}

### üëÜTapping anywhere on the success screen (macos only)

-   Webkit: {@link "macOS integration".privacyDashboardClose}
